   .env.prod  -> Production settings
   ```

2. [ ] Standardize Docker configurations

   ```

### Phase 2: Branch Protection Setup
1. [ ] Configure main branch protection
   ```yaml
   Protection rules:
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks:
     - integration-test
     - docker-build
     - format-backend
     - lint-backend
     - lint-frontend
   - No direct pushes
   ```

2. [ ] Configure test branch protection
   ```yaml
   Protection rules:
   - Require status checks:
     - integration-test
     - format-backend
     - lint checks
   - Allow specified reviewers to bypass
   ```

3. [ ] Configure dev branch basic protection
   ```yaml
   Protection rules:
   - Require basic status checks:
     - format-backend
     - lint checks
   ```

### Phase 2: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
1. [ ] Update existing workflows
   - [ ] Modify integration-test.yml for new environments
   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       branches: [dev]
     pull_request:
       branches: [test, main]
   ```
   - [ ] Update docker-build.yaml for environment-specific builds
   ```yaml
   build-args:
     dev: NODE_ENV=development
     test: NODE_ENV=test
     prod: NODE_ENV=production
   ```

2. [ ] Create deployment workflows
   ```yaml
   dev-deploy:
   - Trigger: Push to dev
   - Actions:
     - Run unit tests
     - Build dev containers
     - Deploy to dev environment

   test-deploy:
   - Trigger: PR to test
   - Actions:
     - Run integration tests

   prod-deploy:
   - Trigger: PR to main
   - Actions:

     - Manual approval
     - Deploy to production
   ```

### Phase 3: Deployment Pipeline
1. [ ] Create deployment workflows
   ```yaml

## Notes
- Existing workflows provide a good foundation
- Integration tests already cover main functionality
- Docker builds are well-configured for multiple architectures
- Format checking is in place for backend code
- Each environment has specific port mappings to avoid conflicts
- Test environment includes Cypress container for automated testing
- Production environment has GPU support and optimized settings
- All environments use isolated networks and volumes
