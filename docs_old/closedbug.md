# Backend Service Debug Resolution

## Resolved Issues

### 1. Missing CHANGELOG.md
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/app/backend/open_webui/CHANGELOG.md'
```

**Resolution:**
1. Added environment variables to bypass changelog check:
```yaml
environment:
  - SKIP_CHANGELOG=true
  - CHANGELOG_CONTENT="{}"
```
2. Created empty CHANGELOG.md file in Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Create empty CHANGELOG.md
RUN touch /app/backend/open_webui/CHANGELOG.md
```

### 2. Start Script Permission
```
/bin/bash: start.sh: No such file or directory
```

**Resolution:**
Added chmod command in Dockerfile to make start.sh executable:
```dockerfile
# Make scripts executable
RUN chmod +x start.sh
```

## Current Status
- Backend service is running successfully
- Database migrations completed
- Non-critical warnings remain:
  - Frontend favicon not found (cosmetic)
  - Frontend splash not found (cosmetic)
  - CORS warning (expected in development)

## Implementation Details
Changes were made in:
1. `.env.dev`: Added debug environment variables
2. `docker-compose.dev.yaml`: Updated script path and environment variables
3. `backend/Dockerfile`: Added file creation and permissions

## Verification
Service startup logs show successful initialization with only expected warnings.
