# Current Work: Environment Deployment and Validation

## Deployment Status
1. Development Environment
   - [x] Core configurations ready
   - [x] Environment variables set
   - [x] Backend service running
   - [x] API health check passing
   - [x] WebSocket connections working
   - [ ] Full environment validation

2. Production Environment
   - [x] Base configurations ready
   - [ ] Security configurations validation
   - [ ] Load testing
   - [ ] Full environment validation

3. Testing Environment
   - [x] Base configurations ready
   - [ ] Test suite setup
   - [ ] CI/CD integration
   - [ ] Full environment validation

## Immediate Tasks

### 1. Environment Validation
#### Development
```bash
# Start development environment
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml --env-file .env.dev up -d

# Validation Steps
1. Verify all services are running:
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml ps

2. Check service logs:
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml logs

3. Test API endpoints:
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

#### Production
```bash
# Start production environment
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml --env-file .env.prod up -d

# Validation Steps
1. Verify all services are running:
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml ps

2. Check service logs:
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml logs

3. Run security scan:
   docker scan whatever-prod-backend
```

#### Testing
```bash
# Start test environment
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yaml --env-file .env.test up -d

# Validation Steps
1. Run test suite:
   docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yaml run backend pytest

2. Check test coverage:
   docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yaml run backend coverage report
```

### 2. Workflow Configuration
1. Development Workflow
   - [ ] Set up hot-reload for development
   - [ ] Configure debug tools
   - [ ] Implement local testing pipeline

2. CI/CD Pipeline
   - [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow
   - [ ] Configure automated testing
   - [ ] Implement deployment stages

3. Testing Strategy
   - [ ] Define test categories (unit, integration, e2e)
   - [ ] Set up test data management
   - [ ] Configure test reporting

## Current Progress (Updated)
### Development Environment Validation 
- [x] All services running:
  - whatever-backend-dev (8080)
  - ollama-dev (11434)
  - whatever-dev (3000)
- [x] Backend health check passing
- [x] WebSocket connections working
- [x] Logs showing normal operation
- [ ] Hot-reload verification needed
- [ ] Debug tools verification needed

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Complete Development Environment
   - [ ] Verify hot-reload functionality
   - [ ] Test debug tools
   - [ ] Document API endpoints

2. Begin Production Environment Validation
   - [ ] Deploy production environment
   - [ ] Run security scan
   - [ ] Validate environment variables

## Validation Checklist
### Development Environment
- [x] All services start successfully
- [ ] Hot-reload working
- [x] API endpoints accessible
- [x] Logs properly captured
- [ ] Debug tools functional

### Production Environment
- [ ] All services start successfully
- [ ] Environment variables secured
- [ ] Resource limits set
- [ ] Logging configured
- [ ] Backup system ready

### Testing Environment
- [ ] All services start successfully
- [ ] Test suite runs completely
- [ ] Coverage reports generated
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integrated
- [ ] Test data isolated

## Next Actions
1. Complete environment validation checklist
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Implement testing strategy
4. Document deployment procedures
