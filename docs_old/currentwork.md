# Branch Cleanup Plan

## Target Branch Structure
```
main
└── test
    └── dev
```

## Steps to Follow

1. [ ] Ensure all changes are committed
   - Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
   - Commit or stash any pending changes

2. [ ] List and backup current branches
   - Run `git branch -a` to see all branches
   - Document important branches that need to be preserved
   - Create local backups if needed

3. [ ] Set up main branch
   - Ensure you're on the main branch: `git checkout main`
   - Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`

4. [ ] Set up test branch
   - Create/checkout test branch from main: `git checkout -b test`
   - Push to remote: `git push -u origin test`

5. [ ] Set up dev branch
   - Create/checkout dev branch from test: `git checkout -b dev`
   - Push to remote: `git push -u origin dev`

6. [ ] Clean up unused branches
   - List local branches to delete
   - Delete local branches: `git branch -d branch_name`
   - Delete remote branches: `git push origin --delete branch_name`

7. [ ] Verify final structure
   - Check branch hierarchy
   - Ensure all branches are properly tracking
   - Verify remote repository structure

## Progress Tracking
- Start Date: Current
- Current Status: COMPLETED 
- Completed Steps: 
  - Initial repository check
  - Created and pushed test branch from main
  - Created and pushed dev branch from test
  - Cleaned up all old local branches
  - Cleaned up all old remote branches
- Notes: 
  - Final branch structure is now in place:
    - main (base)
    - test (from main)
    - dev (from test)
  - All old branches have been removed
  - Upstream remote branches were kept intact
  - Repository is now clean and organized

# Environment and Workflow Setup

## Current Environment Analysis
- Development (Port 3000)
  - Local development environment
  - Hot-reloading enabled
  - Debug features enabled
  
- Test (Port 3002)
  - Integration testing environment
  - Cypress tests mounted
  - Separate data volumes
  
- Production (Port 80)
  - Production-optimized build
  - GPU support enabled
  - Proper resource allocation

## Workflow Plan

### 1. Development Flow (dev branch)
- [ ] Configure automatic tests on push to dev
  - Unit tests
  - Linting checks
  - Format verification
  
### 2. Quality Assurance (test branch)
- [ ] Set up automated deployment to test environment
  - [ ] Create GitHub Action for test deployment
  - [ ] Configure integration tests
  - [ ] Set up automated Cypress tests
  - [ ] Implement test reporting

### 3. Production Pipeline (main branch)
- [ ] Establish deployment pipeline
  - [ ] Create production deployment workflow
  - [ ] Add deployment approval step
  - [ ] Configure rollback mechanism

### 4. Branch Protection Rules
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules
  - [ ] Require pull request reviews
  - [ ] Require status checks to pass
  - [ ] No direct pushes to main or test

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Create GitHub Actions Workflow Files
   ```yaml
   # dev-pipeline.yml
   - Trigger: Push to dev
   - Run: Unit tests, lint, format
   
   # test-pipeline.yml
   - Trigger: PR to test
   - Run: Deploy to test env, integration tests
   
   # prod-pipeline.yml
   - Trigger: PR to main
   - Run: Full test suite, deploy to prod
   ```

2. [ ] Set up Branch Protection
   - main: Require PR + 1 review + all checks
   - test: Require PR + all checks
   - dev: Basic lint/format checks

3. [ ] Configure Environments
   - Create GitHub environments: dev, test, prod
   - Set environment-specific secrets
   - Configure deployment rules

4. [ ] Documentation
   - Update README with workflow details
   - Document deployment process
   - Add troubleshooting guide

## Quality Gates

### Dev to Test
- All unit tests pass
- Code formatting checks pass
- Linting passes
- PR review approved

### Test to Production
- All integration tests pass
- Cypress tests pass
- Security scan clean
- Performance benchmarks met
- PR review approved

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Implement dev pipeline
2. [ ] Set up test environment deployment
3. [ ] Configure production deployment
4. [ ] Add monitoring and alerts
