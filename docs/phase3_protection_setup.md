# Phase 3: Branch Protection Setup

## Summary
This phase implements branch protection rules and code ownership requirements to enforce the new branching strategy and ensure code quality through required reviews and checks.

## Prerequisites Checklist
- [x] Phase 1 and 2 completed successfully
- [x] GitHub admin access available
- [x] All workflows functioning correctly
- [x] Team leads identified for code ownership
- [x] Review processes documented

## 1. Create CODEOWNERS File
- [x] Create .github/CODEOWNERS:
  ```
  # Default owners for everything
  *       @team-leads

  # Backend specific
  /backend/ @backend-team-lead

  # Frontend specific
  /frontend/ @frontend-team-lead

  # Workflow files
  /.github/workflows/ @devops-lead

  # Documentation
  /docs/ @tech-docs-team

  # Docker and deployment configurations
  docker-compose*.yaml @devops-lead
  Dockerfile @devops-lead
  .env* @devops-lead

  # Test configurations
  /cypress/ @frontend-team-lead
  *.test.* @backend-team-lead
  ```
- [x] Status: Successfully implemented and tested

## 2. Configure Branch Protection

### Dev Branch Protection
- [x] Enable branch protection:
  ```
  Settings → Branches → Add rule
  Branch name pattern: dev
  ```
- [x] Configure rules:
  - Required status checks:
    - [x] Format Backend
    - [x] Frontend Build
    - [x] Integration Test (Docker)
  - [x] Require conversation resolution
  - [x] Include administrators
  - [x] Allow force pushes (temporary)
- [x] Status: Successfully implemented

### Test Branch Protection
- [x] Enable branch protection:
  ```
  Settings → Branches → Add rule
  Branch name pattern: test
  ```
- [x] Configure rules:
  - Required status checks:
    - [x] Format Backend
    - [x] Frontend Build
    - [x] Integration Test (Docker)
  - [x] Require pull request reviews
    - [x] Required approvers: 1
    - [x] Dismiss stale reviews
  - [x] Require conversation resolution
  - [x] Include administrators
  - [x] Allow force pushes (temporary)
- [x] Status: Successfully implemented

### Main Branch Protection
- [x] Enable branch protection:
  ```
  Settings → Branches → Add rule
  Branch name pattern: main
  ```
- [x] Configure rules:
  - Required status checks:
    - [x] Format Backend
    - [x] Frontend Build
    - [x] Integration Test (Docker)
    - [x] Deployment Approval
  - [x] Require pull request reviews
    - [x] Required approvers: 2
    - [x] Dismiss stale reviews
  - [x] Require conversation resolution
  - [x] Include administrators
  - [x] Block force pushes
- [x] Status: Successfully implemented

## Implementation Results
1. CODEOWNERS:
   - File created and tested
   - Review assignments working correctly
   - Team permissions verified

2. Branch Protection Rules:
   - All branches protected with appropriate rules
   - Status checks properly enforced
   - Review requirements working
   - Force push restrictions in place

3. Workflow Integration:
   - All status checks passing
   - Review process tested
   - Docker-based tests integrated

## Success Criteria
- [x] Protection rules prevent direct pushes
- [x] Required reviews enforced
- [x] Status checks must pass
- [x] CODEOWNERS file working correctly
- [x] Force push restrictions active

## Verification Steps
1. Test Dev Branch Protection:
   - [x] Try direct push to dev
   - [x] Create PR without tests passing
   - [x] Create PR with passing tests

2. Test Test Branch Protection:
   - [x] Try direct push to test
   - [x] Create PR without reviews
   - [x] Create PR with proper reviews

3. Test Main Branch Protection:
   - [x] Try direct push to main
   - [x] Create PR without approval
   - [x] Create PR with all requirements met

## Rollback Instructions
1. Disable branch protection rules:
   ```
   Settings → Branches → Edit rule → Delete
   ```
2. Restore previous protection settings if needed
3. Document any changes in version history

## Document Management
### Version Control
- This document should be maintained in the `docs` directory
- Follow the branch hierarchy for updates:
  1. Initial changes in `dev`
  2. Validation in `test`
  3. Final approval in `main`

### Branch Navigation
- Document state per branch:
  - `main`: Approved protection rules
  - `test`: Rules being validated
  - `dev`: Latest protection updates
- When switching branches:
  ```bash
  git checkout [branch]
  git pull origin [branch]
  ```
- Commit message format: "docs: update phase3_protection_setup.md - [change summary]"

### Protection Rule Sync
- Document must stay synchronized with actual GitHub settings
- When updating protection rules:
  1. Update GitHub settings
  2. Update documentation
  3. Verify changes
  4. Commit with message: "chore: update protection rules and docs for [branch]"

### Conflict Resolution
- For document conflicts:
  1. Compare with actual GitHub settings
  2. Maintain accuracy with current rules
  3. Document any rule changes
  4. Update version history

### Version History
| Version | Date | Branch | Changes | Author |
|---------|------|---------|----------|---------|
| 1.0.0   | [Current Date] | main | Initial document creation | [Your Name] |
| 1.1.0   | [Current Date] | dev | Implementation and testing complete | [Your Name] |

## Next Steps
✅ Phase 3 Complete - Proceed to Phase 4: Upstream Synchronization Setup
