# Debug Log - Chat Component Build Issues

## Issue 1: Import Path Error
**Error Message:**
```
src/lib/utils/EventHandlers.ts (8:4): "chatId" is not exported by "src/lib/stores/ChatStores.ts"
```

### Root Cause
- `chatId` is being incorrectly imported from `ChatStores.ts` when it should be imported from the main stores file
- This is causing a build failure as the module cannot be found

### Solution Steps
1. Update import path in `EventHandlers.ts`
   - Change import from `ChatStores.ts` to main stores file
   - Verify all other imports are from correct locations

## Issue 2: Import Inconsistencies
### ChatStores.ts 
- Added imports from `$lib/stores` for shared stores
- Added type imports for Message and MessageRole
- Added proper type definitions for all stores
- Fixed processingMessage type to be string | null

### ChatUtils.ts 
- Fixed history import location
- Added imports for processingMessage and pendingMessages
- Added marked and highlight.js for message formatting
- Enhanced message formatting with syntax highlighting
- Added proper type definitions for all functions

### EventHandlers.ts
- `mobile` is imported but not exported in ChatStores
- Missing socket event type definitions

### Chat.new.svelte
Missing core imports:
- `uuid` for ID generation
- `mermaid` for diagram rendering
- `PaneGroup, Pane, PaneResizer` for layout
- `goto` and `page` from `$app/navigation` and `$app/stores`
- `WEBUI_BASE_URL` from constants

### Additional Build Warnings
1. TypeScript Configuration Warning:
```
Cannot find base config file "./.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json"
```
- This is a non-critical warning but should be addressed in future updates

2. Unused Export Properties:
- Multiple components have unused export properties
- These should be reviewed and either used or converted to constants

3. Accessibility Warning:
```
A11y: <video> elements must have a <track kind="captions">
```
- Video element in CallOverlay.svelte needs captions track for accessibility

## Action Items
1. [x] Fix `chatId` import in EventHandlers.ts
2. [x] Fix import inconsistencies in all created files
   - [x] ChatStores.ts
   - [x] ChatUtils.ts
   - [x] EventHandlers.ts
   - [x] Chat.new.svelte
3. [x] Add missing imports to Chat.new.svelte
4. [ ] Review and clean up unused exports
5. [ ] Add captions track to video element
6. [ ] Update tsconfig.json configuration

## Status
- Fixed initial import path issue
- Fixed imports and enhanced functionality in ChatStores.ts and ChatUtils.ts
- Fixed EventHandlers.ts imports
- Fixed Chat.new.svelte imports

## Debug Progress

## Import Fixes

### Completed
- ✓ ChatStores.ts
  - Added proper type definitions
  - Fixed store imports and types
  - Enhanced store initialization
