# Test Protection Rules

This file is created to test our branch protection rules and workflow configurations.

## What we're testing:

1. Branch Protection Rules
   - Proper branch naming
   - Required status checks
   - Required reviews
   - Conversation resolution

2. Workflow Triggers
   - Integration tests on PR
   - Format checks
   - Build verification
   - Docker environment tests

3. Code Ownership
   - Documentation team ownership
   - Proper review assignments

## Expected Behavior
- PR should trigger all configured workflows
- Required reviewers should be automatically assigned
- Merging should be blocked until all checks pass
