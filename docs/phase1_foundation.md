# Phase 1: Foundation Setup

## Overview
Phase 1 focuses on establishing the core infrastructure and basic integration components for ComfyUI within the Open WebUI platform.

## Key Components

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- ComfyUI Container Configuration
  - Base image selection and configuration
  - GPU support integration (using existing docker-compose.gpu.yaml patterns)
  - Volume mapping for persistent storage
  - Network configuration for service communication

- Environment Configuration
  - Extension of existing environment variables
  - ComfyUI-specific settings integration
  - Integration with current logging and monitoring
  - Configuration inheritance from base Open WebUI setup

- Docker Compose Integration
  - Update docker-compose.yaml for ComfyUI service
  - Configure service dependencies
  - Network setup for inter-service communication
  - Resource allocation and limits

### 2. Core Service Integration
- Image Generation Service Extension
  - Integration with existing authentication system
  - Error handling and validation using current patterns
  - Reuse of image storage mechanisms
  - Extension of current API endpoints

- WebSocket Manager Implementation
  - Leverage existing WebSocket infrastructure
  - Session management integration
  - Message handling structure for ComfyUI
  - Progress tracking implementation

- Configuration System
  - Environment variable management
  - Settings persistence
  - Integration with existing configuration patterns
  - Secure credential handling

### 3. Basic Frontend Integration
- API Layer Extensions
  - ComfyUI endpoint integration
  - Error handling consistency
  - Authentication flow integration
  - Response formatting standardization

- Initial UI Components
  - Basic workflow interface
  - Progress indicators
  - Error display
  - Status notifications

## Implementation Priorities
1. ComfyUI Container Setup
   - Configure base container
   - Set up volume mounts
   - Configure networking
   - Implement health checks

2. Core Integration
   - Extend image generation service
   - Implement WebSocket handlers
   - Set up configuration system

3. Frontend Foundation
   - Add API endpoints
   - Create basic UI components
   - Implement error handling

## Success Criteria
- ComfyUI container successfully running and accessible
- Basic WebSocket communication established
- Simple image generation requests working
- Frontend displaying basic status and results
- All existing Open WebUI functionality maintained

## Dependencies
- Existing authentication system
- Current image storage infrastructure
- WebSocket base implementation
- Docker compose configuration
- Environment management system

## Testing Requirements
- Container health checks
- WebSocket connection tests
- Basic image generation flow
- Authentication integration verification
- Environment variable validation
- Network connectivity verification

## Security Considerations
- Authentication token handling
- WebSocket connection security
- Image storage permissions
- Environment variable protection
- Network isolation between services

## Monitoring and Logging
- Container health monitoring
- WebSocket connection logging
- Image generation tracking
- Error logging integration
- Performance metrics collection
