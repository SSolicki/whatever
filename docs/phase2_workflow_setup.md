# Phase 2: Workflow Configuration

## Summary
This phase focuses on updating and configuring the CI/CD workflows to match the new branch structure. It ensures all automated tests and builds trigger on the appropriate branches.

## Prerequisites Checklist
- [x] Phase 1 completed successfully
- [x] GitHub admin access available
- [x] CI/CD environment variables configured
- [x] Team notified of workflow changes

## 1. Update Existing Workflows

### Integration Test (integration-test.yml)
- [x] Backup created via workflow-backup branch
- [x] Updated trigger configuration:
  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - dev
        - test
    pull_request:
      branches:
        - test
        - main
  ```
- [x] Implemented Docker-based testing:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    cypress-run:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Build and run Test Stack
          run: docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yaml up --detach --build
        - name: Run Cypress Tests
          run: docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yaml run --rm whatever-cypress
  ```
- [x] Status: Successfully implemented and tested

### Backend Format (format-backend.yaml)
- [x] Backup created via workflow-backup branch
- [x] Updated trigger configuration:
  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - dev
        - dev/**
    pull_request:
      branches:
        - test
        - main
  ```
- [x] Status: Successfully implemented

### Frontend Build (format-build-frontend.yaml)
- [x] Backup created via workflow-backup branch
- [x] Updated trigger configuration:
  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - dev
        - dev/**
    pull_request:
      branches:
        - test
        - main
  ```
- [x] Status: Successfully implemented

## 2. Create New Workflow

### Deployment Approval (deployment-approval.yml)
- [x] Created new workflow file with configuration:
  ```yaml
  name: Deployment Approval
  on:
    pull_request:
      branches:
        - main
  jobs:
    approval:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      environment: production
      steps:
        - name: Checkout Repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - name: Pending Approval
          uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
          with:
            draft: true
  ```
- [x] Status: Successfully implemented

## 3. Environment Configuration
- [x] Set up GitHub environments:
  - Development (dev)
    - Auto-deploy enabled
    - No approval required
  - Testing (test)
    - Auto-deploy enabled
    - Requires one reviewer
  - Production (main)
    - Manual deployment
    - Requires two reviewers
- [x] Configure environment secrets:
  - WEBUI_SECRET_KEY
  - OLLAMA_BASE_URL
  - Additional environment-specific variables
- [x] Set up deployment approvers per environment

## Success Criteria
- [x] All workflows trigger on correct branches
- [x] Integration tests run on dev and test branches
- [x] Format checks run on dev branches
- [x] Build processes complete successfully
- [x] Deployment approval workflow creates drafts
- [x] Docker-based testing environment works correctly

## Implementation Results

   - Successfully migrated to Docker-based testing
   - Verified with test PR from feature branch
   - All tests passing in containerized environment

2. Format and Build Workflows:
   - Updated branch triggers
   - Verified on feature branch PRs
   - Successfully running on dev branches

3. Deployment Approval:
   - Implemented and tested on main branch
   - Successfully creating draft releases
   - Proper environment gates in place
