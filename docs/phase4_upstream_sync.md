# Phase 4: Upstream Synchronization Setup

## Summary
This phase establishes a structured process for synchronizing with the upstream repository (open-webui/open-webui) through a dedicated sync branch, ensuring clean integration of upstream changes into the local development workflow.

## Prerequisites Checklist
- [x] Phases 1-3 completed successfully
- [x] Upstream remote configured correctly
- [x] GitHub admin access available
- [x] Team notified of new sync process
- [x] No pending local changes in main branches

## 1. Create Sync Branch Structure

### Initial Setup
- [x] Create sync branch from main:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git checkout -b sync/upstream
  git push -u origin sync/upstream
  ```
- [x] Status: Successfully created

### Configure Upstream Remote
- [x] Verify upstream remote:
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  # Result:
  # origin    https://github.com/SSolicki/whatever.git (fetch)
  # origin    https://github.com/SSolicki/whatever.git (push)
  # upstream  https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui.git (fetch)
  # upstream  https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui.git (push)
  ```
- [x] Status: Already configured correctly

## 2. Create Sync Workflow

### Create Sync Automation (.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml)
- [x] Created workflow file with configuration:
  ```yaml
  name: Upstream Sync

  on:
    schedule:
      - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily at midnight
    workflow_dispatch:      # Manual trigger

  jobs:

              git add .
              git commit -m "chore: resolve merge conflicts from upstream"
            }
