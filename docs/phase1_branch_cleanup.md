# Phase 1: Branch Cleanup and Restructuring

## Summary
This phase focuses on cleaning up existing branches and establishing the new branch hierarchy: main → test → dev. This phase must be completed before implementing new workflows and protection rules.

## Prerequisites Checklist
- [x] All team members notified of upcoming changes
- [x] No active development in progress
- [x] Access to force push to protected branches (if any exist)

## 1. Backup Current State
- [x] Create backup of current branch structure:
  ```bash
  # Initial state backed up on [Current Date]
  dev
  feature/test-workflow
  main
  test
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/bugs/test-fix-001
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/feature/test-workflow
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/test
  remotes/upstream/dev
  remotes/upstream/main
  remotes/upstream/pypi-release
  ```

## 2. Clean Outdated Branches
- [x] Remove local feature branch:
  ```bash
  git branch -d feature/test-workflow
  # Result: Deleted branch feature/test-workflow (was 25cb6bdca)
  ```
- [x] Remove remote feature branch:
  ```bash
  git push origin --delete feature/test-workflow
  # Result: Successfully deleted feature/test-workflow
  ```
- [x] Remove outdated bug fix branch:
  ```bash
  git push origin --delete bugs/test-fix-001
  # Result: Successfully deleted bugs/test-fix-001
  ```

## 3. Branch Restructuring
- [x] Update main branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  # Result: Already up to date
  ```
- [x] Reset test branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout test
  git reset --hard main
  git push origin test --force
  # Result: test branch now matches main (abd0ef8c4)
  ```
- [x] Reset dev branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout dev
  git reset --hard origin/test
  git push origin dev --force
  # Result: dev branch now matches test
  ```

## 4. Verify New Structure
- [x] Verify branches are properly aligned:
  ```bash
  # Current branch structure:
  dev
  main
  test
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/test
  remotes/upstream/dev
  remotes/upstream/main
  remotes/upstream/pypi-release
  ```
- [x] All branches aligned to commit: cleaning (abd0ef8c4)

## Success Criteria
- [x] Main, test, and dev branches exist and are properly aligned
- [x] Old feature and bugfix branches are removed
- [x] All branches can be pushed to without errors
- [x] Branch hierarchy is verified with git log

## Document Management
### Version Control
- This document should be maintained in the `docs` directory
- Changes to this document should follow the branch hierarchy:
  1. Make changes in `dev` branch
  2. Test in `test` branch
  3. Finally merge to `main`
- Include version history at bottom of document

### Branch Navigation
- When switching branches, this document should be treated as follows:
  - `main`: Contains the stable, approved version
  - `test`: Contains the version being validated
  - `dev`: Contains the latest updates and changes
- Document changes should be committed with message: "docs: update phase1_branch_cleanup.md"
- Always pull latest version before making changes:
  ```bash
  git checkout [branch]
  git pull origin [branch]
  ```

### Conflict Resolution
- If conflicts occur in this document:
  1. Always keep the most detailed version
  2. Merge changes from both versions if possible
  3. Consult team lead for resolution if needed
  4. Document significant conflict resolutions in version history

### Version History
| Version | Date | Branch | Changes | Author |
|---------|------|---------|----------|---------|
| 1.0.0   | [Current Date] | main | Initial document creation | [Your Name] |
| 1.1.0   | [Current Date] | main | Updated with implementation results | [Your Name] |
