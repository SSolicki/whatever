# ComfyUI Integration - Phase 2 Implementation Checklist

## Overview
Phase 2 focuses on validating and ensuring the existing ComfyUI integration works correctly within the whatever platform. The core implementation exists in `apps/images`, and our primary goal is to verify and test the current implementation.

## Current Status
Based on code analysis, the ComfyUI implementation has the following components:
- Core functionality in `apps/images/utils/comfyui.py`
- FastAPI endpoints in `apps/images/main.py`
- Configuration management through environment variables (already set up in Phase 1)
- WebSocket-based communication for real-time updates

## Tasks

### 1. Verify Phase 1 Configuration
- [ ] Confirm environment variables are properly loaded
  - [ ] Verify COMFYUI_BASE_URL is accessible
  - [ ] Check COMFYUI_WORKFLOW is properly formatted
  - [ ] Validate COMFYUI_WORKFLOW_NODES structure
- [ ] Test Docker container connectivity
  - [ ] Verify ComfyUI service is running
  - [ ] Test network communication between services
  - [ ] Confirm model access and loading

### 2. Test Existing Implementation
- [ ] Validate WebSocket Communication
  - [ ] Test connection to ComfyUI server
  - [ ] Verify message handling (queue_prompt, get_images)
  - [ ] Monitor WebSocket connection stability
- [ ] Test Current Workflow Processing
  - [ ] Verify existing workflow execution
  - [ ] Test image generation pipeline
  - [ ] Validate output handling and storage
- [ ] Check Integration Points
  - [ ] Test FastAPI endpoint responses
  - [ ] Verify configuration management
  - [ ] Validate image processing pipeline

### 3. Error Handling Assessment
- [ ] Review Current Error Handling
  - [ ] Test connection failure scenarios
  - [ ] Verify error message formatting
  - [ ] Check cleanup procedures
- [ ] Document Error Cases
  - [ ] List common failure points
  - [ ] Document error patterns
  - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

### 4. Basic Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Implement Essential Logging
  - [ ] Add WebSocket communication logs
  - [ ] Track generation success/failure
  - [ ] Log configuration status
- [ ] Setup Basic Health Checks
  - [ ] Monitor ComfyUI service status
  - [ ] Track WebSocket connection health
  - [ ] Verify workflow processing state

## Next Steps
1. Begin with configuration verification
2. Test existing functionality
3. Document any issues found
4. Create basic monitoring setup

## Notes
- Focus on validating existing implementation
- Document any issues for Phase 3 enhancement
- Maintain minimal changes to avoid regression
