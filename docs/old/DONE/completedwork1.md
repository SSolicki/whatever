# Task: Create Knowledge Store Documentation
Date Started: 2024-02-22
Date Completed: 2024-02-24

## Enhanced Task Description
This task involves creating a new documentation file (`docs/features/knowledgestore.md`) that comprehensively describes the existing knowledge store feature. The documentation should provide clear understanding of how the feature works, its components, and usage patterns. Any existing documentation that references knowledge store functionality should be updated to maintain consistency.

Key objectives:
- Create comprehensive feature documentation in `knowledgestore.md` ✓
- Ensure documentation aligns with existing documentation standards ✓
- Update cross-references in other documentation files if needed ✓

     * API endpoints and usage
     * Security and permissions
     * Integration points
     * Best practices
     * Troubleshooting guide
     * Related documentation links
     * Version history
