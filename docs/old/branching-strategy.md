## Branch Descriptions

### Main Branch
- Production-ready code
- Deployed to production environment
- Protected branch requiring two approvals
- All tests must pass
- Automated deployment to production

### Release Branch
- Staging environment
- Integration testing
- Protected branch requiring one approval
- Automated deployment to staging
- Merges from Integration branches

### Teams Branches
Teams branches represent different development streams:

#### Frontend Teams
- Path: `teams/frontend/*`
- Frontend development work
- Component development
- UI/UX improvements
- Individual team workspaces

#### Backend Teams
- Path: `teams/backend/*`
- Backend development work
- API development
- Database changes
- Service implementations

#### Feature Teams
- Path: `teams/feature/*`
- Cross-functional feature development
- New feature implementations
- Major enhancements

### Integration Branches
Integration branches consolidate work from team branches:

#### Frontend Integration
- Path: `integration/frontend`
- Consolidates frontend team work
- Integration testing for frontend
- UI/UX validation

#### Backend Integration
- Path: `integration/backend`
- Consolidates backend team work
- API integration testing
- Service integration validation

#### Feature Integration
- Path: `integration/feature`
- Consolidates feature work
- End-to-end testing
- Feature validation

### Bugs Branch
- Path: `bugs/*`
- Hotfix development
- Critical bug fixes
- Can merge directly to main (with approval)
- Immediate deployment capability

## Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch
- Requires 2 approvals
- Must be up to date before merging
- Status checks must pass
- No direct pushes
- Administrators included

### Release Branch
- Requires 1 approval
- Must be up to date before merging
- Status checks must pass
- No direct pushes

### Integration Branches
- Requires 1 approval
- Status checks must pass
- Team lead review required

### Team Branches
- Basic protection
- Linting checks required
- Unit tests must pass

## Workflow Guidelines

### Creating New Features
1. Create branch from appropriate team branch
2. Develop and test locally
3. Push to team branch
4. Create PR to integration branch
5. After integration testing, merge to release
6. Finally, merge to main

### Bug Fixes
1. Create branch from bugs/*
2. Implement fix
3. Test thoroughly
4. Create PR to main
5. After approval, merge and deploy

### Release Process
1. Merge integration branches to release
2. Run integration tests
3. Deploy to staging
4. Verify in staging
5. Create PR to main
6. Deploy to production

## Branch Naming Convention

### Team Branches
- Frontend: `teams/frontend/subteam<N>`
- Backend: `teams/backend/subteam<N>`
- Feature: `teams/feature/subteam<N>`

### Integration Branches
- Frontend: `integration/frontend`
- Backend: `integration/backend`
- Feature: `integration/feature`

### Bug Branches
- Format: `bugs/subteam<N>`

## Commit Guidelines
- Use conventional commits
- Include ticket number
- Keep commits focused
- Write clear messages

## Pull Request Process
1. Create PR to appropriate branch
2. Add description and context
3. Link related issues
4. Request reviews
5. Address feedback
6. Merge when approved
