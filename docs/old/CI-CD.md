## Test Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Required for all code changes
- Run in parallel
- Coverage requirements:
  - Frontend: 80%
  - Backend: 85%
  - Features: 80%

### Integration Testing
- Run on integration branches
- API contract testing
- Service integration
- Database migrations

### End-to-End Testing
- Run on release branch
- Full user journey testing
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile responsiveness

### Performance Testing
- Load testing
- Stress testing
- Memory profiling
- Response time benchmarks

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Per-team deployments
- Feature previews
- Quick iteration
- Debug logging enabled

### Integration Environment
- Combined team work
- Feature validation
- Integration testing
- Performance profiling

### Staging Environment
- Production-like setup
- Full testing suite
- Data migration testing
- Performance validation

### Production Environment
- Blue-Green deployment
- Automated rollback
- Zero-downtime updates
- Production monitoring

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Health Checks
- Service availability
- API endpoints
- Database connections
- Cache status

### Performance Metrics
- Response times
- Error rates
- Resource usage
- User metrics

### Security Monitoring
- Vulnerability scanning
- Dependency audits
- Access logging
- Security alerts

### Incident Response
- Automated alerts
- Rollback triggers
- Team notifications
- Incident tracking

## Pipeline Configuration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - release
      - 'integration/**'
      - 'teams/**'
      - 'bugs/**'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - release
      - 'integration/**'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install
        run: npm ci
      - name: Test
        run: npm run test:all

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy
        run: npm run deploy
      - name: Monitor
        run: npm run monitor
```

## Required Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:unit": "jest",
    "test:integration": "jest --config=jest.integration.js",
    "test:e2e": "cypress run",
    "test:all": "npm run test:unit && npm run test:integration && npm run test:e2e",
