   - Better fits existing microservices architecture
   - More suitable for containerization
   - Better API-first approach

2. **Resource Efficiency:**
   - Lower base resource requirements
   - More efficient scaling capabilities
   - Better resource utilization

3. **Development Control:**
   - More flexibility in implementation
   - Better control over features
   - Easier to maintain and modify

4. **Future-Proofing:**
   - Better suited for future scaling
   - More adaptable to changing requirements
   - Easier to extend and customize

While this approach requires more initial development effort, it provides a more sustainable and maintainable solution in the long term.
