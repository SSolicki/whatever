## Recommendation

Based on the expanded analysis, ComfyUI remains the recommended choice for integration with Open WebUI for the following reasons:

1. **Architecture Alignment:**
   - Better fits existing microservices architecture
   - WebSocket support enables real-time feedback
   - More suitable for containerization
   - Better API-first approach

2. **Resource Efficiency:**
   - Lower base resource requirements
   - More efficient scaling capabilities
   - Better resource utilization
   - Flexible workflow management

3. **Development Control:**
   - More flexibility in implementation
   - Better control over features
   - Comprehensive node-based system
   - Real-time processing feedback

4. **Future-Proofing:**
   - Better suited for future scaling
   - More adaptable to changing requirements
   - Easier to extend and customize
   - Support for complex workflows

While this approach requires more initial development effort, particularly in WebSocket management and workflow configuration, it provides a more sustainable and maintainable solution in the long term. The ability to provide real-time feedback and support complex workflows makes it particularly suitable for advanced image generation applications.

## Maintenance Considerations
