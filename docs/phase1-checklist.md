# ComfyUI Integration - Phase 1 Implementation Checklist

## Overview
Phase 1 focuses on setting up the infrastructure for ComfyUI integration within our existing whatever platform. This phase establishes the foundational components needed for image generation capabilities.

## Tasks

### 1. Analysis and Requirements 
- [x] Review current docker-compose.dev.yaml structure
- [x] Identify required ComfyUI models and dependencies
- [x] Document GPU requirements and compatibility (pre-checked)
- [x] Map out integration points with existing whatever services

### 2. Docker Configuration 
- [x] Add ComfyUI service to docker-compose.dev.yaml with configuration:
  ```yaml
  comfyui:
    image: comfyui/comfyui
    container_name: whatever-comfyui-dev
    ports:
      - "8188:8188"
    volumes:
      - ./data/comfyui:/data
      - ./models:/models
    environment:
      - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all
    networks:
      - whatever_network_dev
  ```
- [x] Create necessary volume mounts for models and data
- [x] Configure network settings to communicate with whatever services

### 3. Environment Setup 
- [x] Update .env.example with ComfyUI-specific variables:
  - ENABLE_IMAGE_GENERATION
  - IMAGE_GENERATION_ENGINE
  - COMFYUI_BASE_URL
  - COMFYUI_WORKFLOW
  - IMAGE_SIZE
  - IMAGE_STEPS
- [x] Configure model paths in environment
- [x] Document new environment variables

### 4. Integration Testing (Pending)
- [ ] Verify ComfyUI container starts successfully
- [ ] Test GPU access from ComfyUI container
- [ ] Confirm network connectivity between services
- [ ] Validate model loading
- [ ] Test basic image generation functionality

### 5. Code Review and Merge (Pending)
- [ ] Review all configuration changes
- [ ] Test complete docker-compose stack
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Merge to Image-generation branch

## Definition of Done
- ComfyUI service running in development environment
- All configurations documented and tested
- Successfully communicating with other whatever services
- Basic image generation functionality verified
- Changes merged to Image-generation branch

## Notes
- GPU compatibility has been pre-verified
- ComfyUI integration points already exist in the codebase
- Using existing whatever networking infrastructure
- Configuration follows whatever platform standards
