# Task: Implement Collaboration Feature with Chat Integration

## Enhanced Task Description
Implement a real-time document collaboration system that leverages the existing chat infrastructure while adding collaborative editing capabilities. The system should support multiple users editing documents simultaneously with integrated AI assistance through the chat interface.

## Step-by-Step Plan

1. Review and Analysis
   - [x] Review chat system architecture and components
   - [x] Review collaboration system requirements
   - [x] Identify reusable chat components:
     - Message streaming infrastructure from Chat.svelte
     - WebSocket connection management from $lib/apis/streaming
     - Layout components (Sidebar.svelte, MessageArea/)
     - Permission system from ChatPermissions interface
     - File handling via $lib/apis/files
     - Real-time updates and UI components from Overview system

2. Architecture Design
   - [x] Design document store integration with chat store:
     - Extend Chat interface to include document reference
     - Reuse ChatPermissions for document access control
     - Integrate DocumentStore with existing store patterns
     - Share WebSocket connection between chat and document
   - [x] Plan WebSocket event handling:
     - Extend existing streaming API for document operations
     - Reuse message broadcasting infrastructure
     - Add document-specific events (cursor, selection)
     - Implement presence awareness
   - [x] Design operation transformation system for conflict resolution:
     - Implement operational transform for concurrent edits
     - Use timestamp-based conflict detection
     - Support insert, delete, replace, and format operations
     - Handle reconnection with operation sync
     - Integrate with version control system
   - [x] Define shared interfaces between chat and collaboration systems:
     - Unified permissions system (ChatPermissions + DocumentPermissions)
     - Common content handling (ArtifactSystem for both chat and documents)
     - Shared WebSocket event system
     - Unified security and validation
     - Common store patterns for state management

3. Core Components Implementation
   - [x] Create document store and interfaces:
     - Implement DocumentStore with Svelte stores
     - Define Document, Operation, and related interfaces
     - Add store methods for document operations
     - Implement cursor and selection tracking
   - [x] Create document utilities:
     - Implement operational transformation
     - Add conflict resolution
     - Create document operation handlers
     - Add version control support
   - [ ] Extend Chat.svelte to support document collaboration mode
     - [x] Extract services into separate files:
       - ChatMessageHandler.ts: Message and event handling
       - ModelManager.ts: Model selection and management
       - PromptHandler.ts: Chat prompt processing
       - FileHandler.ts: File upload and processing
     - [x] Split UI into smaller components:
       - ChatHeader.svelte: Navigation and chat controls
       - ChatBody.svelte: Message display area
       - ChatFooter.svelte: Input and actions
     - [ ] Integrate document collaboration features:
       - Add document mode state handling
       - Connect document WebSocket events
       - Implement mode switching logic
   - [x] Create CollaborateLayout.svelte using chat layout patterns

4. Feature Integration
   - [x] Integrate rich text editor with chat interface
   - [ ] Implement document version history
   - [x] Add participant presence indicators
   - [ ] Connect AI assistant to document context

5. UI/UX Implementation
   - [x] Create document toolbar with formatting options
   - [ ] Implement sidebar for document management
   - [ ] Add version history timeline
   - [ ] Design participant list and status indicators

6. Testing and Optimization
   - [ ] Test real-time synchronization
   - [ ] Verify conflict resolution
   - [ ] Validate AI assistance integration
   - [ ] Performance testing for large documents

7. Documentation
   - [ ] Update technical documentation
   - [ ] Add API documentation for new endpoints
   - [ ] Create usage guides for collaboration features
   - [ ] Document integration patterns

## Notes/Comments
- Leverage existing chat WebSocket infrastructure for document updates
- Ensure backward compatibility with current chat features
- Focus on smooth integration between chat and document editing
- Maintain type safety across all new components
- Consider implementing feature flags for gradual rollout
- Reuse chat permission system for document access control
- Utilize existing file handling system for document attachments
- Share single WebSocket connection for both chat and document operations
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Use operational transform for conflict-free concurrent editing
- Maintain version history for document recovery
- Unified security and validation across systems
- Common store patterns for consistent state management
- Document operations are handled through a centralized store
- Real-time cursor and selection tracking implemented
