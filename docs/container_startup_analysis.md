# Container Startup Issue Analysis

## Error Description
The application is failing to start due to a missing module error when trying to run the development environment. Specifically, the error occurs when trying to execute the `prepare-pyodide.js` script.

## Key Error Details
- Error: `Cannot find module '/app/scripts/prepare-pyodide.js'`
- Error Code: `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`
- Environment: Node.js v20.18.1
- Command being executed: `npm run pyodide:fetch && vite dev --host`

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **File Path Issue**: 
   - The error indicates that Node.js is looking for the script at `/app/scripts/prepare-pyodide.js`
   - This path suggests the script is being looked for in a Docker container (note the `/app` prefix)
   - The script is not being found at the expected location

2. **Volume Mounting**:
   - This is likely a Docker volume mounting issue
   - The `scripts` directory may not be properly mounted into the container
   - Alternatively, the working directory structure inside the container might not match the expected layout

3. **Script Location**:
   - The `prepare-pyodide.js` script is referenced in the npm scripts but may not be:
     - Present in the correct location
     - Included in the Docker image
     - Properly copied during the build process

## Potential Solutions

1. **Verify File Structure**:
   - Ensure the `scripts/prepare-pyodide.js` exists in the project
   - Confirm the file path in package.json matches the actual file location

2. **Docker Configuration**:
   - Review Dockerfile to ensure proper COPY instructions for the scripts directory
   - Check volume mounting in docker-compose files
   - Verify working directory configuration

3. **Development Setup**:
   - Ensure all development dependencies are properly installed
   - Verify the script is included in version control
   - Check if the script needs to be generated or downloaded as part of setup

## Next Steps
1. Examine the Dockerfile and docker-compose configurations
2. Verify the existence and location of prepare-pyodide.js
3. Review the package.json script definitions
4. Check volume mounting configurations
