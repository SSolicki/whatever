# Current Work: Documentation Optimization

## Project Overview
We are optimizing and consolidating the project's documentation structure to improve clarity, maintainability, and AI-friendliness. The goal is to create a comprehensive, well-organized documentation system that serves as both a reference for developers and a knowledge base for AI assistance.

## Project Context
- Web UI Chat Application built with SvelteKit
- Real-time communication capabilities
- Type-safe architecture
- Knowledge store integration
- AI model integration
- File processing capabilities
